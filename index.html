		<p> My favorite actor is Amitabh Bachchan becuase he has a good look and is very wise,kind and a little funny.Amitabh Bachchan is an Indian film actor, film producer, television host, occasional playback singer and former politician. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for films such as Zanjeer, Deewaar and Sholay, and was dubbed as India's "angry young man" for his on-screen roles in Hindi films.</p>
